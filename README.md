# Keylogger
Keystroke logging, often referred to as key-logging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. This script tracks all the keystrokes from a windows PC once activated and curates them in a separate file named 'output.txt'.
