# Keylogger
Keystroke logging, often referred to as key-logging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. 
These are computer programs designed to work on the target computer’s software. Keyloggers are used in IT organizations to troubleshoot technical problems with computers and business networks. Families and business people use keyloggers legally to monitor network usage without their users’ direct knowledge. However, malicious individuals can use keyloggers on public computers to steal passwords or credit card information.

This script tracks all the keystrokes from a windows PC once activated and curates them in a separate file named 'output.txt'.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) pywin32
2) pyhook

Save the python script file in 'C:\Keylogger.py' directory and run the python file. 

OUTPUT:
The keylogger will be started in the background and save all the data on the log file “c:\output.txt”.
